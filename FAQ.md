## Security

### Q: Is this extension secure?
**A:** Yes, for its intended purpose. It uses SHA-256 password hashing and stores data locally. However, it's designed for casual protection, not enterprise security. See SECURITY.md for details.

### Q: Can someone uninstall the extension without the password?
**A:** When locked, the extension blocks access to chrome://extensions. However, someone with system access or developer knowledge could potentially disable it. This is a limitation of browser extensions.

### Q: Where is my password stored?
**A:** Your password is hashed using SHA-256 and stored locally in Chrome's encrypted storage. It never leaves your computer.

### Q: Can I recover my password if I forget it?
**A:** No, there is no password recovery. If you forget your password, you'll need to:
1. Close Chrome completely
2. Reopen and quickly go to chrome://extensions
3. Remove the extension
4. Reinstall and set a new password

### Q: Is my browsing data collected?
**A:** No! This extension:
- Does NOT collect any data
- Does NOT send data to any servers
- Works completely offline
- Is open source - you can review the code

## Features

### Q: What is auto-lock?
**A:** Auto-lock automatically locks your browser after a period of inactivity (5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes). Enable it in the extension settings.

### Q: Can I change my password?
**A:** Yes! When unlocked, click the extension icon, then click "Change Password". You'll need to enter your current password first.

### Q: Does it work on all websites?
**A:** Yes, it works on all regular websites. However, it cannot lock Chrome's internal pages (chrome://, chrome-extension://) due to browser security restrictions.

### Q: Can I use this on multiple computers?
**A:** Yes, but you'll need to install it separately on each computer. Passwords don't sync between installations.
